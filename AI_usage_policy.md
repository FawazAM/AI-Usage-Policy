# AI Usage Policy

## Introduction
This policy outlines our organization's acceptable use of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions to ensure their safe, responsible, and ethical use and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. AI solutions, including machine learning algorithms and natural language processing tools, can provide valuable insights and accelerate work. However, it is important to use them responsibly to ensure data privacy and security.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party partners who use AI solutions within our organization.

## Responsibilities:
- Employees who use AI solutions must ensure that they are using the solutions in accordance with the organization's policies and guidelines.
- Employees must protect confidential data, including personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, intellectual property, and other sensitive data, and only use AI solutions for authorized purposes.
- Employees must report any security breaches or data privacy incidents to their supervisor or IT department immediately.

## Data Privacy:
- Employees must not share confidential data with AI solutions that do not have a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) with the organization.
- All AI solutions must be reviewed and approved by the organization's IT department before being used by employees.
- Employees must ensure that they only use AI solutions that have been assessed for data privacy compliance and that meet the organization's data privacy standards.

## Ethical Use:
- Employees must use AI solutions in a manner that is consistent with the organization's ethical standards.
- AI solutions must not be used to discriminate against individuals or groups based on any protected characteristics, such as race, gender, religion, age, disability, or sexual orientation.
- Employees must ensure that the output generated by AI solutions is used responsibly and ethically and that human reviews any decisions made using AI solutions.

## Monitoring and Oversight
We will regularly monitor the use of AI within our organization to ensure that it is being used in accordance with this policy and relevant laws and regulations. This may include regular audits, risk assessments, and performance evaluations. In addition, we will establish appropriate oversight mechanisms to ensure that AI is being used ethically and responsibly.

## Updates:
This policy will be reviewed and updated at least once a year, or more frequently as needed, to ensure that it remains current and relevant.

## Conclusion
By following these guidelines, we can ensure that AI is used safely, responsibly, and aligned with our organization's values and principles. We encourage all employees to actively promote ethical AI use and report any concerns or issues related to AI use to their manager or the appropriate internal authority.
